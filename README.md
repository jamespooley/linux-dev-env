**NOTE:** This is a WIP so no "one script to install them all" is ready ... yet.

An attempt to get most of the software I need to get my work done centralized in one place.

I've yet to make the switch to [Z shell](https://linuxconfig.org/learn-the-basics-of-the-zsh-shell), and the evergreen bash is still
my shell of choice. However, this may be a mistake ... I can't make up my mind here.

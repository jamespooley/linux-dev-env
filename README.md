Scripts to get my Linux development environment up and running

### Overview

**NOTE:** This is a WIP so no "one script to install them all" is ready ... yet.

An attempt to get most of the software I need to get my work done centralized in one place.

I've yet to make the switch to Z shell, and the evergreen bash is still
my shell of choice. However, this may be a mistake ... I can't make up my mind here.

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jamespooley/linux-dev-env.git && cd linux-dev-env
$ ./python.sh
```
